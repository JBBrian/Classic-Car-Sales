# SUMMARY
I searched around the internet for a database I could analyze that simulates real world professional sales work analysis and a product I'm familiar with. This sample company specializes in selling classic car model toys. They have multiple employees and offices around the globe. This data encompasses 2+ years of company performance.

# OVERVIEW
I ran the database creation script in MySQL and briefly explored the data in order to familiarize myself with the tables and contents I would be working with. To begin my analysis I drafted up some research questions and set out to create some queries to analyze the data. After querying the data for my answers, I then created a dashboard to help digest the data.


# RESEARCH QUESTIONS

- What are the top selling products?
- What is our biggest account/client?
- Who are the top 10 performing empoloyees?
- What are the total sales per year (2003-2005)
- How many accounts do we hold?
- How many orders per month?
- What is our top performing location?
